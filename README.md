# React example using es2015

On the react site there is a demo on how to learn to think with react. Me coming in a bit later to the scene. I was already looking forward into integrating React into my webpack workflow. Here is the same demo but using the latest technologies in Frontend development.

``
npm install 
``

``
npm run build
``
  
``
npm start 
``
